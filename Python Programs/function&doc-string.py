# Functions
# a=8
# b=6
# c=sum((a,b))    #this is built in function
      # remember inside the sum function there should be touple(),list[] and etc
# print(c)


# for user defined function we have to use "def" function

# def function1(a,b):
#       print("hello you are in function1",a+b)
# function1(4,5)

# How to print "doc string"   it help us to read the code

# def function2(a,b):
#       """ This is how we calculate average of two number """
#       average=(a+b)/2
#       print(average)
# function2(5,7)
# print(function2.__doc__) 
# remember this __doc__ function
