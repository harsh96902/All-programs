# Operaters in python

# Arithemetic Operaters
# Assignment Operaters
# Comparision Operaters
# Logical Operaters
# Identify Operaters
# Membership Operaters
# Bitwise Operaters

# Arithemetic Operaters
print("4+5 is",4+5)
print("4-5 is",4-5)
print("4*5 is",4*5)
print("4/5 is",4/5)
print("4//5 is",4//5)  # for getting int value( without .0)
print("4**5 is",4**5)  # for the power

# Assignment Operaters
a=3
a +=3 # we can use it for adding any num and we can use any arithmetic operaters in place of +
print(a)

# Comparision Operaters
p=1
q=2
print(p>q)
print(p==1)   # for checking value

# logical Operaters

a= True
b= False
print( a and b)
print(a or b)      # we are using logical operaters and , or , is not
print(a is not b)

# Identify Operaters
print(5 is not 6)     # to identify it is or not\

# Membership operaters

list=[23,32,4,5,4,6,446,57,7,6]
print( 25 in list)       # to check the item is in list or not


# Bitwise Operaters

# binary value
# 0 = 00
# 1 = 01       for guidance only
# 2 = 10
# 3 = 11

print(0 & 1)
print(0 | 1)
print(1 | 2)
